package org.demo // Kotlin code is usually defined in packages. Package specification is optional: If you don't specify a package in a source file, its content goes to the default package.

fun main() {   // Entry point to a Kotlin application is the main function. Since Kotlin 1.3, you can declare main without any parameters. The return type is not specified, which means that the function returns nothing.
    println("Hello, World!")
